const SUPERVISOR_ID = 'supervisor-id';
connly.barge(CALL_UUID, SUPERVISOR_ID);
```

---

#### `subscribeCalls()`

Subscribes to live call feed events.

```javascript
connly.subscribeCalls();
```

#### `monitorCalls()`

Subscribes to ongoing call events.

```javascript
connly.monitorCalls();
```

---

#### `subscribeAgents()`

## üî• Event Handlers (With Examples)

These are callback functions that can be overridden to handle specific events emitted by the SDK.

### `onConnect(data)`

Triggered when the socket connection is successfully established.

```javascript
connly.onConnect = (data) => {
    console.log('Connected to Connly platform:', data);
    connly.subscribeCalls(); // Example: Subscribe to live calls once connected
};
```

---

### `onDisconnect(data)`

Triggered when the socket connection is disconnected.

```javascript
connly.onDisconnect = (data) => {
    console.log('Disconnected from Connly platform:', data);
};
```

---

### `onCalls(data)`

Triggered when a new call event occurs.

```javascript
connly.onCalls = (data) => {
    console.log('New Call Event:', data);
    console.log(`Caller: ${data.from}, Agent: ${data.agent}, UUID: ${data.uuid}`);
};
```

---

### `onAgents(data)`

Triggered when agent statuses or the agent list is updated.

```javascript
connly.onAgents = (data) => {
    console.log('Agent Updates:', data);
};
```

---

### `onStatus(data)`

Triggered on status updates or errors (e.g., invalid token).

```javascript
connly.onStatus = (data) => {
    console.log('Status Update:', data);
};
```

---

### `onCount(data)`

Triggered on incoming call count updates.

```javascript
connly.onCount = (data) => {
    console.log('Incoming Call Count:', data);
};
```

---

### `onagentAnswer(data)`

Triggered when an agent answers a call.

```javascript
connly.onagentAnswer = (data) => {
    console.log('Agent Answered Call:', data);
};
```

---

### `onAnswer(data)`

Triggered when a customer answers a call.

```javascript
connly.onAnswer = (data) => {
    console.log('Customer Answered Call:', data);
};
```

---
